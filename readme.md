This is a virtual tennis game, based on a classic.
	
Originally a summer project from years back, and my first attempt at a non-command line C program. I later returned to it to fix some glaring issues after learning more about C.

Collision uses basic axis-aligned bounding boxes, rendering is done using SDL2.
